# Do_It_Like_Tesla
An Intra-club activity conducted by Consulting &amp; Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati

# Event Description
As part of a consulting firm you have received a full fledged case by the executives of a Startup X. The case involves coming up with an innovative marketing strategy for Startup X to expand their market base and reap greater revenues. You'll be working in teams of 2 and are expected to give an in-depth explanation of your idea in the form of a ppt and also prepare a short pitch to present to the executives. As your mentors, weâ€™ll be assisting you to successfully navigate through the case and
improve your knowledge and skill set during the same time. To make the process simple we have subdivided the case into 3 tasks which will be provided as and when you submit the previous ones, after which a final deliverable needs to be submitted. Any genuine additions in the ppt apart from the tasks are most welcomed.
